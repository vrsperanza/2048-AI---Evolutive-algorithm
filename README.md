Genetic algorithm made to play the game: 2048

This project contains a original and optimized 2048 game simulator.

The algorithm receives a game board, runs each alternative resulting from each possible move in such board throught a simple perceptron.
After evaluating several games and getting a score for each robot in the population, it separates an elite, and crosses every bot with the best ones, generating new bots and replacing all the ones not part of the elite.

Once the training is complete, it shows, step by step, games played by the best bot.
